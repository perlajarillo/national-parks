# National Parks US

This web app shows the location of the National Parks in US and provides a short description of each.

## Development notes

National Parks was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project uses [React-ArcGIS](https://github.com/Esri/react-arcgis) library of React components which uses the [ArcGIS API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) for JavaScript. The ArcGIS REST Services are provided by [esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview).

## To build the application

The first step is to clone this repository in your local machine and then, open a terminal and cd into the project directory and then follow this steps:

1. run `npm install`

   This command will install all the necessary dependencies. [React-ArcGIS](https://github.com/Esri/react-arcgis) and [babel-core](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-core) are some of them.

2. run `npm start`

   This command runs the app in the development mode.<br>
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

   The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
   You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
